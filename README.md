# hello-world
My first Github repository, nothing here to see, just hello world

This is my first foray into GitHub, so this is just some sample text to follow along in their tutorial for using and navigating the GitHub source controls tools.  Currently looking at editing in a branch of changes, in particular this ReadMe document.

Me, I'm a contract Design Developer doing work in Unity3D, C#, UWP for Microsoft.  Woo Hoo!  I don't like moon tacos, bleck!  LA based Tittos tacos on the other hand, mmmm.
